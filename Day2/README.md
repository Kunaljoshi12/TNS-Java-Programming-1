Exercise-1:

Create a class Dog, that has 3 properties (class fields) breed, age and colour with behaviours (class method) bark and sleep.

Exercise-2:

There is a car, which has attributes model and price, and the car has functionalities start, stop and move. Also, there is a driver, having attributes name and age, and the behaviour drive.
Model the classes Car and Driver. You need to take care of the accessibility of the attributes from outside the class for the best design.

Exercise-3:

Car Class

Create a new class named Car that has the following fields:
year - The year field is an int that holds a car's year model (e.g. 2015)
make - The make field is a String object that holds the make of the car (e.g. "Honda")
speed - The speed field is an double that holds a car's maximum speed (e.g. 85.0)
In addition, the Car class should have the following methods.
Constructor - The constructor should accept the car's year, make, and beginning speed as arguments
These values should be used to initialize the Car's year, make, and speed fields
Getter Methods - Write three accessor (getter) methods to get the values stored in an object's fields getYear(), getMake(), getSpeed()

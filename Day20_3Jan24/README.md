## Generics in Java
- Generics is a feature of the Java programming language that allows you to define classes, methods, and interfaces that can work with multiple data types. This can help to improve the flexibility and reusability of your code.
Generics are declared using angle brackets (< >), and the type parameters are listed inside the angle brackets.


## Generic class
- A class that can refer to any type is known as a generic class. Here, we are using the T type parameter to create the generic class of specific type.

## Generic Method
- Like the generic class, we can create a generic method that can accept any type of arguments. Here, the scope of arguments is limited to the method where it is declared. It allows static as well as non-static methods.


## Generic Constructor
- A generic constructor is a constructor that has at least one parameter of a generic type. Generic constructors don't have to be in a generic class, and not all constructors in a generic class have to be generic.
